const String reduceText = "Reduce/Reduction: to make something smaller or use less, resulting in a smaller amount of waste.\nYou can practice reduction by selecting products that do not have to be added to landfills or the waste stream in general.\n\nStep 1: Is there something else that can be used for this purpose? Using multi-use items is essential to beginning reduction. \nOne example would be a coffeepot and a cappuccino maker. Both of them distinctly do different things, but you can buy a coffeepot that has a steaming attachment on it so it can do both. The purchase of one item means that you don’t use two. It reduces the amount of production and the amount of waste packaging material that will be generated.\n\n Step 2: Is this something that needs to be done? \n\nA lot of our waste material comes from items that are considered to be “disposable.” Not in the sense that you use something once and then throw it away, that can actually be a part of environmental responsibility when you are working with medical items – disposable in this sense means whether or not what the item allows you to do has any real meaning or purpose.";
const String reuseText = "You can \"reuse\" materials in their original form instead of throwing them away, or pass those materials on to others who could use them too! Remember, one man's trash is another man's treasure! Here are some examples of reuse.\n\nReuse below items:\nOld jars and pots: Old jars and pots can be used to store items in the kitchen. They can also be used to store loose items together, such as computer wires.\nTyres: Old tyres can either be sent to the recycling station or can be used to make tyre-swing.\nUsed wood: Used wood can be used as firewood or can be used as woodcraft.\nNewspaper: Old newspapers can be used to pack items when you’re planning to move to another home or store old items.\nEnvelopes: Old and waste envelopes can be used by children to make short notes.\nWaste paper: Waste paper can be used to make notes and sketches and can be sent to the recycling center when you don’t need them anymore.\nOld jeans or t-shirts or any clothes: These can be turned into bags or tote-bags with the help of tutorials available on the internet. At least old clothes can become cleaning rags.";
const String recycleText = "Recycle—don’t just toss everything in the trash. Lots of things can be remade into either the same kind of thing or new products. Making new items from recycled ones also takes less energy and fewer resources than making products from brand new materials.\n\nOne of the issues bothering communities that want to become more involved with a recycling effort is that while the relying collection and sorting process may be affordable to implement, there still has to be a facility to receive and transform the discarded waste into a raw material to produce new products.More progress is being made toward uniting recycling plants with industries that can process the waste material through agreements and incentive credits.\n\nOne needs to learn as to what products can be recycled and what they cannot. By carefully choosing the products that can be recycled, it can be the first step towards efficient recycling.";
